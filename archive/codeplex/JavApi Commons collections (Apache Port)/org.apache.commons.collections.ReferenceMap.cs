    /**
     *  Hash-based {@link Map} implementation that allows
     *  mappings to be removed by the garbage collector.<p>
     *
     *  When you construct a <code>ReferenceMap</code>, you can 
     *  specify what kind of references are used to store the
     *  map's keys and values.  If non-hard references are 
     *  used, then the garbage collector can remove mappings
     *  if a key or value becomes unreachable, or if the 
     *  JVM's memory is running low.  For information on how
     *  the different reference types behave, see
     *  {@link Reference}.<p>
     *
     *  Different types of references can be specified for keys
     *  and values.  The keys can be configured to be weak but
     *  the values hard, in which case this class will behave
     *  like a <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/java/util/WeakHashMap.html">
     *  <code>WeakHashMap</code></a>.  However, you
     *  can also specify hard keys and weak values, or any other
     *  combination.  The default constructor uses hard keys
     *  and soft values, providing a memory-sensitive cache.<p>
     *
     *  The algorithms used are basically the same as those
     *  in {@link java.util.HashMap}.  In particular, you 
     *  can specify a load factor and capacity to suit your
     *  needs.  All optional {@link Map} operations are 
     *  supported.<p>
     *
     *  However, this {@link Map} implementation does <I>not</I>
     *  allow null elements.  Attempting to add a null key or
     *  or a null value to the map will raise a 
     *  <code>NullPointerException</code>.<p>
     *
     *  As usual, this implementation is not synchronized.  You
     *  can use {@link java.util.Collections#synchronizedMap} to 
     *  provide synchronized access to a <code>ReferenceMap</code>.
